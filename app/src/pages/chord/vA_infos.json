She hosts a radio show called \"Horie Yui no Tenshi no Tamago\" and is the founding member of the singing group, Aice\u2075. She is also a member of the band Kurobara Hozonkai, with the name Yuiel. Her hobbies include shoulder massage, reading and cooking. As a child, she was a huge fan of the anime series Dirty Pair and has later stated that the series was her first inspiration to become a voice artist. She debuted in 1997 in a video game Voice Fantasia and for several years had minor roles in various anime. She landed her first leading role as Haruka in Kurogane Communication. The turning point in her career wasn't till the year 2000, when she won the role of Narusegawa Naru in the popular anime Love Hina. Other notable and defining career moments were taking the role of Honda Tooru in the anime Fruits Basket in 2001, and releasing her 1st music album (Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai) in 2000. She has since become one of the most popular anime voice actresses in Japan. Horie formed a temporary unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with the popular seiyuu Tamura Yukari in 2001. They released two singles, Mou Hitori no Watashi and Merry Merrily\u2014the latter of which was an insert song in the Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve. In October, 2005 she founded Aice\u2075, a J-Pop group consisting of 4 other seiyuu, to help launch their careers. Aice\u2075 was officially disbanded on September 20, 2007. She has collaborated with a few other artists, such as Unscandal in 2005 and Kurobara Hozonkai, a Japanese Goth band, in 2007. She was employed by Arts Vision until mid-2007 due to a scandal within the agency's top management, at which point she left to become a freelance seiyuu unaffiliated with any talent management firm. She has published 6 independent musical albums. Nearly all of them incorporate at least one track from an anime she has worked with. She currently releases music under the Starchild label (a subdivision of King Records).

He is also part of the seiy\u016b quartet Weiss consisting of Weiss Kreuz voice castmates Shinichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki, and Yuuki Hiro. He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T's Factory, a seiyuu company he founded in 1998. Koyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bish\u014dnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the mangaka of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu's voice in mind; the seiy\u016b ended up voicing this character in the series' drama CDs. Koyasu is also the creator of the Wei\u00df series, and has authored the manga Wei\u00df Side B. In creating Wei\u00df Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death. Koyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime. He also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer.

As of February 1, 2016, he became a freelance. He also hosted MAG Net between April 2014 to March 2013 with fellow seiyuu Saori Gotou. Together with a fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi, he is the host of \u795e\u8c37\u6d69\u53f2\u30fb\u5c0f\u91ce\u5927\u8f14\u306eDear Girl \uff5eStories\uff5e which is one of the oldest and one of the most prevalent seiyuu-hosted radio programs. He has hosted various other programs including Ono Daisuke, Kondou Takayuki no Yume Bouken~Dragon&Tiger with seiyuu Takayuki Kondou. He formed the air band \"MASOCHISTIC ONO BAND\" with Kamiya Hiroshi that debuted at Nippon Budoukan in 2013, whose personnel consist of the staff of DGS radio program. He is part of the \"D.A.T\" singing unit with Kondo Takayuki since 2012; \"D.A.T\" sings in the annual \"Marine Super Wave Live.\" He is the leader of \"DABA,\" a project created in 2008 bringing together Fukuyama Jun, Hino Satoshi, Tachibana Shinnosuke, Suganuma Hisayoshi, Majima Junji and Kondo Takayuki, they are all male voice actors born in 1978. In addition, he is also a part of the singing sub unit of \"DABA\"; \"CABA,\" active since 2014. He is the leader and host of the annual OrePara live (founded in 2008), with Suzumura Kenichi, Morikubo Showtaro & Terashima Takuma (replacing Iwata Mitsuo from 2014 onward). In DGS radio program, he has admitted that he is not fond of cats because of his unpleasant childhood experience with them. This is quite ironic considering his character in Kuroshitsuji, Sebastian Michaelis, is obsessed with cats. However, it seems that Ono Daisuke has no problem at all with Nyanko-sensei or Nya-san, a cat that belongs to his fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi. He dislikes raisins, but loves Chinese noodles, nuts and almonds. He has a certain fascination in Buddha statue. The first time he saw the biggest Buddha statue in the world was on his birthday celebration in Ushiku-shi, a place he had wanted to visit, which is also Kamiya Hiroshi's hometown.
