Frequently these stories have fast cuts, tough characters making quick decisions and usually a beautiful girl nearby. Anything quick and most likely a thin storyline.","Adventure":"Exploring new places, environments or situations. This is often associated with people on long journeys to places far away encountering amazing things, usually not in an epic but in a rather gripping and interesting way.","Cars":"Anime whose central theme revolves around cars and probably car races. A single character\'s obsession for cars does not mean that it should belong to this genre. Most of these stories also are in the action genre.","Comedy":"Multiple characters and/or events causing hilarious results. These stories are built upon funny characters, situations and events.","Dementia":"Anime that have mind-twisting plots.","Demons":"Anime that are set in a world where demons and other dark creatures play a significant role - the main character may even be one.","Drama":"Anime that often show life or characters through conflict and emotions. In general, the different parts of the story tend to form a whole that is greater than the sum of the parts. In other words, the story has a message that is bigger than just the story line itself.","Ecchi":"Anime that contain a lot of sexual innuendo. The translation of this letter (Ecchi is the letter \'H\' in Japanese) is pervert. Ecchi is about panties (pantsu) and bra/breast showing, situations with \'sudden nudity\' and of course, subtle hints or sexual thoughts. Ecchi does not describe actual sex acts or show any intimate body parts except for bare breasts and buttocks. Ecchi is almost always used for humor.","Fantasy":"Anime that are set in a mythical world quite different from modern-day Earth. Frequently this world has magic and/or mythical creatures such as dragons and unicorns. These stories are sometimes based on real world legends and myths. Frequently fantasies describe tales featuring magic, brave knights, damsels in distress, and/or quests.","Game":"Anime whose central theme is based on a non-violent, non-sports game, like go, chess, trading card games or computer/video games.","Harem":"Anime that involves one lead male character and many cute/pretty female support characters. Typically, the male lead ends up living with many female support characters within the same household. The lead male typically represents the average guy who is shy, awkward, and girlfriendless. While each female character surround the lead male possesses distinct physical and personality traits, those traits nevertheless represent different stereotypical roles that play on popular Japanese fetishes; i.e. the librarian/genius, tomboy, little sister, and older woman. Some anime that are under the harem genre are: Love Hina, Girls Bravo, Maburaho, and Sister Princess.","Hentai":"Anime whose central theme is explicit sex. Hentai is sex with usually a very small storyline, comparable with normal porn. Hentai can range from normal couple\'s sexual relationship to a wide variety of fetishes and perversions.","Historical":"Anime whose setting is in the past. Frequently these follow historical tales, sagas or facts.","Horror":"Anime whose focus is to scare the audience.","Josei":"","Kids":"Anime whose target audience is children.

Weapons use, like Nunchaku and Shuriken are also indications of this genre. This is a sub-genre of action.","Mecha":"Anime whose central theme involves mechanical things.

Human size androids are in general not considered \'Mecha\' but \'SciFi\'.","Military":"An anime series/movie that has a heavy militaristic feel behind it.","Music":"Anime whose central theme revolves around singers/idols or people playing instruments. This category is not intended for finding AMVs (Animated Music Videos).","Mystery":"Anime where characters reveal secrets that may lead a solution for a great mystery. This is not necessarily solving a crime, but can be a realization after a quest.","Parody":"Anime that imitate other stories (can be from TV, film, books, historical events, ...) for comic effect by exaggerating the style and changing the content of the original. Also known as spoofs.

Shounen Ai literally means \'boy love\', but could be expressed as \'male bonding\'.","Slice of Life":"Anime with no clear central plot. This type of anime tends to be naturalistic and mainly focuses around the main characters and their everyday lives. Often there will be some philosophical perspectives regarding love, relationships, life etc. tied into the anime. The overall typical moods for this type of anime are cheery and carefree, in other words, it is your \'feel-good\' kind of anime. Some anime that are under the slice of life genre are: Ichigo Mashimaro, Fruits Basket, Aria the Natural, Honey and Clover, and Piano.","Space":"Anime whose setting is in outer space, not on another planet, nor in another dimension, but space.

She hosts a radio show called \\"Horie Yui no Tenshi no Tamago\\" and is the founding member of the singing group, Aice\u2075. She is also a member of the band Kurobara Hozonkai, with the name Yuiel. Her hobbies include shoulder massage, reading and cooking. As a child, she was a huge fan of the anime series Dirty Pair and has later stated that the series was her first inspiration to become a voice artist. She debuted in 1997 in a video game Voice Fantasia and for several years had minor roles in various anime. She landed her first leading role as Haruka in Kurogane Communication. The turning point in her career wasn\'t till the year 2000, when she won the role of Narusegawa Naru in the popular anime Love Hina. Other notable and defining career moments were taking the role of Honda Tooru in the anime Fruits Basket in 2001, and releasing her 1st music album (Mizutamari ni Utsuru Sekai) in 2000. She has since become one of the most popular anime voice actresses in Japan. Horie formed a temporary unit called Yamato Nadeshiko with the popular seiyuu Tamura Yukari in 2001. They released two singles, Mou Hitori no Watashi and Merry Merrily\u2014the latter of which was an insert song in the Love Hina Christmas Special: Silent Eve. In October, 2005 she founded Aice\u2075, a J-Pop group consisting of 4 other seiyuu, to help launch their careers. Aice\u2075 was officially disbanded on September 20, 2007. She has collaborated with a few other artists, such as Unscandal in 2005 and Kurobara Hozonkai, a Japanese Goth band, in 2007. She was employed by Arts Vision until mid-2007 due to a scandal within the agency\'s top management, at which point she left to become a freelance seiyuu unaffiliated with any talent management firm. She has published 6 independent musical albums. Nearly all of them incorporate at least one track from an anime she has worked with. She currently releases music under the Starchild label (a subdivision of King Records).

He is also part of the seiy\u016b quartet Weiss consisting of Weiss Kreuz voice castmates Shinichiro Miki, Tomokazu Seki, and Yuuki Hiro. He used to work for Production Baobab but is now the head of T\'s Factory, a seiyuu company he founded in 1998. Koyasu is known for his deep, smooth voice, which often lands him in roles that are either villains or lonely bish\u014dnen. Recently, though (as in the cases of Mitsurugi Hanagata from Saber Marionette J, Ryo Kuroyanagi from Yakitate!! Japan, Bobobo-Bo-Bobobo, and Kei Itoshiki from Zoku Sayonara Zetsubo Sensei) he has been voicing more and more lively/humorous characters. According to Hisaya Nakajo, the mangaka of the series Hana-Kimi, the character of Masao Himejima was designed with Koyasu\'s voice in mind; the seiy\u016b ended up voicing this character in the series\' drama CDs. Koyasu is also the creator of the Wei\xdf series, and has authored the manga Wei\xdf Side B. In creating Wei\xdf Kreuz, Koyasu was inspired by an old Japanese series called Sure Death. Koyasu often voices under the pseudonym Hayato Jumonji, especially in H anime. He also narrates promotional videos and pre-flight safety videos for StarFlyer.

As of February 1, 2016, he became a freelance. He also hosted MAG Net between April 2014 to March 2013 with fellow seiyuu Saori Gotou. Together with a fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi, he is the host of \u795e\u8c37\u6d69\u53f2\u30fb\u5c0f\u91ce\u5927\u8f14\u306eDear Girl \uff5eStories\uff5e which is one of the oldest and one of the most prevalent seiyuu-hosted radio programs.

In DGS radio program, he has admitted that he is not fond of cats because of his unpleasant childhood experience with them. This is quite ironic considering his character in Kuroshitsuji, Sebastian Michaelis, is obsessed with cats. However, it seems that Ono Daisuke has no problem at all with Nyanko-sensei or Nya-san, a cat that belongs to his fellow seiyuu Kamiya Hiroshi. He dislikes raisins, but loves Chinese noodles, nuts and almonds. He has a certain fascination in Buddha statue. The first time he saw the biggest Buddha statue in the world was on his birthday celebration in Ushiku-shi, a place he had wanted to visit, which is also Kamiya Hiroshi\'s hometown.
